<p>Pets are companion animals. Humans keep them for friendship rather than for economic reasons. Most people's consideration for choosing pets are attractiveness and playfulness. For instance, many people like to keep cute and cuddly animals as friends. Some people like to keep active pets. The two most common domestic companions are of course the cat and the dog. However, some people like to keep exotic pets like snakes or spiders.

<p>Remarkable stories about animals are widespread all over the world. One of the most memorable is that of Hachiko. He is an Akita dog from Japan. Each afternoon, he would wait for his master named Professor Ueno to return home at a train station. However, one day his master died. Despite this, Hachiko kept going to the train station every day for nine years. His loyalty gained him the attention of the people in his country and of the world. Statues of Hachiko were built to remember his exceptional loyalty.

<b>A.</b>
<br>
<b>F</b>:  It may be hard to believe this but there was once a pet pig who saved her master's life.
<br>
<b>M</b>:  What? A pig? I have heard about loyal dogs but pigs?
<br>
<b>F</b>:  That is true! There was a pig named Lulu whose master had a heart attack. To get help, she went out in the streets to stop the traffic and to catch the attention of the people.
<br>
<b>M</b>:  What happened next?
<br>
<b>F</b>:  Finally someone followed her back to her house and found his master in pain. Her master was saved, thanks to Lulu the pig.

<p>
<b>B.</b>
<br>
<b>M</b>:  Do you prefer dogs or cats?
<br>
<b>F</b>:  I think I prefer cats. They are quiet and mysterious but they are also friendly at times. How about you?
<br>
<b>M</b>:  I'm absolutely a dog-lover! They are faithful and full of energy. Dogs are great playmates, too.
<br>
<b>F</b>:  Oh well, I just prefer to sit and lie down so I like cats.
<br>
<b>M</b>:  Really, dogs are better! You can walk them in the park when you jog or exercise.
<br>
<b>F</b>:  Cats are better! They are not needy or naughty!
<br>
<b>M</b>:  Dogs are better! Hmmm.. but I guess that depends on one's personality.
