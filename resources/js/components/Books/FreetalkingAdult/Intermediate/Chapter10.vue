   <p>The prizes set up by Nobel for physics, chemistry, medicine, and literature were first handed out in 1901. Later, in 1968 the Bank of Sweden added a prize in economics to celebrate the bank’s 300th year of business.
   </p>
   <p>Nobel bequeathed 94% of his total assets, 31 million SEK (c. US$186 million, €150 million in 2008), to establish the five Nobel Prizes. Because of skepticism surrounding the will, it was not until 26 April 1897 that it was approved by the Storting in Norway. The executors of Nobel's will, Ragnar Sohlman and Rudolf Lilljequist, formed the Nobel Foundation to take care of Nobel's fortune and organize the award of prizes.

<p>Nobel's instructions named a Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Peace Prize, the members of whom were appointed shortly after the will was approved in April 1897. Soon thereafter, the other prize­ awarding organizations were designated or established. These were the Karolinska Institutet on June 7th, the Swedish Academy on June 9th, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on June 11th. The Nobel Foundation reached an agreement on guidelines for how the prizes should be awarded; and, in 1900, the Nobel Foundation's newly-created statutes were promulgated by King Oscar II. In 1905, the personal union between Sweden and Norway was dissolved. Thereafter, Norway's Nobel Committee was responsible for awarding the Nobel Peace Prize and the Swedish institutions retained responsibility for the other prizes.
