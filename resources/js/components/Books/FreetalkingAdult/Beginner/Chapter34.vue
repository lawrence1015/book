               <div style="padding : 16px;">

<p>The place I live in is a young city. In fact, it is considered a "baby" because it has not been a city for even a year yet! Because we have many facilities, establishments and a good economy, the government awarded us as the status of a city! Our hospital is located along Valencia St, beside San Martin's University. Behind it stands a Buddhist Temple. However, my family goes to a Christian Church located along Privet Drive. Across it is a bakery which sells the best egg pies I have ever tasted. Beside the bakery is a boutique that sells our town's handicrafts such as shell lamps and wooden statues.

<b>A.</b>
<br>
<b>M</b>:  Excuse me Miss. Good day to you! I would like to ask how to get back to the hotel. I think I got lost from wandering around the city.
<br>
<b>F</b>:  Good day! Oh, you just walk straight along this road and turn right. Continue walking until you see the bakeshop then turn left. You should be able to see the hotel building.
<br>
<b>M</b>:  Umm .. Can you please repeat that? I didn't catch everything!
<br>
<b>F</b>:  Oh, I will just right you a map. Can you wait a minute please?
<br>
<b>M</b>:  Sure! Thank you very much! F: You're welcome. Just be careful next time.
<br>
<b>M</b>:  Can you also tell me how to get to the Palm Spring's Resort?
<br>
<b>F</b>:  Oh, I think I need to draw another map then!
</p>

<p>
<b>B.</b>
<br>
<b>F</b>:  Are you sure that the pet clinic is across Dolly's Shop? There seems to be no pet shop here'
<br>
<b>M</b>:  Yes, I am sure. According to the veterinarian, we just need to walk along Demi Street and turn left. I am pretty sure she said it is across Dolly's Shop.
<br>
<b>F</b>:  Their office used to be inside the mall near my office. I don't know why they were relocated. It was much more convenient for me if they were still there.
<br>
<b>M</b>:  But the good thing here is that it is now near the nicest cafes in the city!
<br>
<b>F</b>:  Look, over there! It's the pet shop!
<br>
<b>M</b>:  Finally we found it!
<br>
<b>F</b>:  And it is across Rolly's Shop, not Dolly's!
