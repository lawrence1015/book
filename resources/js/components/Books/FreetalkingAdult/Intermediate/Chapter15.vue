               <div style="padding : 16px;">

   <p>Crisscrossing the continents to pursue and quench one's thirst for pleasurable experience we all deserve after days, months or years of hard work, may it be your dream vacation or just to savor the taste of some of the world's most famous festivals, we have to prepare for unexpected acquaintances which could turn out to be sometimes more prolific than the usual relationships we build around us in a commonplace.
   </p>
   <p>So here comes the smartphone advantage! Most people these days won't settle with just having feature phones. Such technology is a little bit off especially to people on the go every day. Smartphone serves as your most portable drive for photos, messages and data files. So, going to a distant place and coming back in to your origin might consider possessing this technology with you all the time. You don't want to lose once in a lifetime moments of your travel, and not to keep in touch with newly met suspected great comrades, do you?

 <p>The term smartphone appeared in 1997 when Ericsson, one of Sweden's largest companies and a provider of telecommunications equipment and data communications systems, described its GS88 "Penelope" concept as a "Smart Phone".
 </p>

 <p>
   The Simon was the first device that can be properly referred to as a "smartphone", even though that term was not yet coined. In addition to its ability to make and receive cellular phone calls, Simon was also able to send and receive facsimiles, e-mails and pages through its touch screen display. Simon included many applications including an address book, calendar, appointment scheduler, calculator, world time clock, games, electronic notepad, handwritten annotations and standard and predictive touchscreen keyboards.
 </p>

 <p>
   Its full name in the market was Simon Personal Communicator and was marketed on August 16, 1996 by BellSouth. BellSouth is an American telecommunications holding company based in Atlanta, Georgia and was one of the seven original Regional Bell Operating Companies after the U.S. Department of Justice forced the American Telephoneand telegraph company to divest itself of its regional telephone companies on January 1, 1984.
 </p>

   Today, cell phone manufacturers have their own smartphones to boast. Nokia, Samsung,Apple, Ericsson, HTC, RIM - the maker of Blackberry and Motorola have come
   up with their own versions of smartphones using their self-developed
   OS's.
