   <p>After crisscrossing the globe with its famous festivals and fascinating islands with your smartphones, let us be thrilled and be entertained by amazing rides and unique architectures of the renowned theme parks around the world.
   </p>
   <p>In common language, theme park is often used as a synonym for the term
'amusement park', but a 'theme park' is actually a distinct style of amusement park. A theme park has landscaping, buildings, and attractions that are based on one or more specific themes or stories. Despite many older parks adding themed rides and areas, qualifying the park as a theme park, the first park built with the original intention of promoting a specific theme, Santa Claus Land located in Santa Claus, Indiana, did not open until 1946.
   </p>
   <p>
     Disneyland, located in Anaheim, California, built around the concept of encapsulating multiple theme parks into a single amusement park is often mistakenly cited as the first amusement park, but is instead the theme park that made the idea popular. Theme parks, a specific type of amusement parks, are usually much more intricately themed to a certain subject or group of subjects than normal amusement parks.

   <li>The world is like a ride in an amusement park. And when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round. It has thrills and chills and it's very brightly coloured and it's very loud and it's fun, for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question: "Is this real, or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us, they say, "Hey, don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride." And we kill those people.
