               <div style="padding : 16px;">

<p>As a cop, it is my obligation to implement the law in my country. Arresting and scolding people is a serious and stressful job but it should be done to keep peace and progress. The commonly broken laws are usually related to traffic. Some drivers do not follow the traffic lights and sometimes are over speeding. Some pedestrians are also stubborn! They cross inappropriate areas and do not follow the traffic lights too! It gets really risky, exciting and frightening if we are chasing robbers or criminals. So far, I haven't used my gun while on duty and I wish I never will.

<p>
  Read the following with your teacher, and identify the adverbs of manner used.
</p>

  <p>
  <b>A.</b>
  <br>
  <b>F</b>: What are the weirdest laws you have ever heard about?
  <br>
  <b>M</b>: Are there such things? I thought laws are supposed to keep peace and order in a place. Weird laws sound ridiculous.
  <br>
  <b>F</b>: That's true but there really are such things! In France, it is illegal to sell dolls that do not have human faces. In Massachusetts, USA, you can get arrested for not taking a bath before going to bed.
  <br>
  <b>M</b>: Are you kidding? That is totally crazy!
  <br>
  <b>F</b>: No, I am serious!
  </p>

  <p>
  <b>B.</b>
  <br>
  <b>M</b>:  You should research the laws of a country before travelling there.
  <br>
  <b>F</b>:  Why is that? When travelling, I already have many things to think about like food, lodging, money, etc.
  <br>
  <b>M</b>:  But this is really important. You can get arrested if you break some unknown and weird rules.
  <br>
  <b>F</b>:  What do you mean?
  <br>
  <b>M</b>:  Hmm ... For example, in Singapore, chewing gums are illegal. And in Portugal, cops will arrest you if you pee in the ocean!
  <br>
  <b>F</b>:  Oh! Really? I am actually going to Singapore next week!
