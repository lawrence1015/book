   <p>It's a fact that because of the natural beauty of the places around the world, almost everyone desires to see the sights. If one could always travel for free, then he would say hello and bid goodbye so often to spots he would have been. Unfortunately, it's too rare to travel for free. It's the funds that impede us from doing so, and that's the truth.
   </p>
   <p>Don't feel sorry for yourself if you're one of those who couldn't afford traveling most conveniently. Say hello to backpacking! At least be grateful to Giovanni francescogemelli Careri, an Italian traveler and adventurer who was believed to have started the idea of backpacking. Gemelli Careri was born in Taurianova, 1651, and died in Naples, 1725. He obtained a doctorate in law at the College of Jesuits in Naples. After completing his studies he briefly entered the judiciary.
   </p>
   <p>In 1685 he took time off to travel around Europe (France, Spain, Germany, and Hungary). While people have traveled for all history with their possessions in packs they carry on their backs, the concept of modern backpacking can be traced, at least partially to the Hippie Trail of the 1960s and '70s.
   </p>
   <p>The hippie trail was the journey taken by hippies and others in the 1960s and 1970s from Europe overland to and from southern Asia, mainly in India and Nepal. One of the key elements was traveling as cheaply as possible, mainly to extend the length of time away from home. As such, journeys were carried out by thumbing (hitchhiking), or cheap, private buses that travelled the route.

 <div style="padding : 16px;">

 <p>Another way of savoring the wonders of the world the cheaper way is through budget airlines. Budget airline is an airline that generally has lower fares and fewer comforts. To make up for revenue lost in decreased ticket prices, the airline may charge for extras like food, priority boarding, seat allocating, and baggage etc. The term originated within the airline industry referring to airlines with a lower operating cost structure than their competitors. While the term is often applied to any carrier with low ticket prices and limited services, regardless of their operating models, low-cost carriers should not be confused with regional airlines that operate short flights without service, or with full-service airlines offering reduced fares. As one of the common practices, some low-cost carriers operate aircraft configured with a single passenger class, and most operate just a single type of aircraft. In the past, low-cost carriers tended to operate older aircraft, such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and older models of the Boeing 737. Since 2000, fleets generally consist of smaller, newer, more fuel efficient aircraft, commonly the Airbus A320 or Boeing 737 families, reducing training and servicing costs.

 <div style="padding : 16px;">

 <p>The price policy of the low cost carriers is usually very dynamic, with discounts and tickets in promotion. Like other carriers, even if the advertised price may be very low, it often does not include charges and taxes. With some airlines, some flights are advertised as free (plus
applicable taxes, fees and charges). Depending on the airline, perhaps as many (or as few) as ten percent of the seats on any flight is offered at the lowest price, and is the first to sell. The prices steadily rise thereafter to a point where they can be comparable or more expensive than a flight on a full-service carrier.
