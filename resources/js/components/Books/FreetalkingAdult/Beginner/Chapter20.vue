               <div style="padding : 16px;">

<p>Walt Disney will remain as one of the most popular and inspiring people to ever live in this world. He is best known as an American director, producer and animator. Before he became highly successful, he was first a boy in a poor family of four brothers and one sister. Throughout his life, he continued to keep and develop his interest in drawing and performing.  He met many failures in his life. He had been rejected several times when he was still starting out.  In the end, because of his persistence, he had given the world the gift of animation, optimism and imagination. Disney's life will always serve as a story of inspiration.

<p>Possessive Forms
</p>

<li style="list-style-type: none;">A. Possessive Nouns
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">To indicate possession or ownership, we have to add -'5 to a name. However, when the word has one syllable and ends with the letter s, we just have to add -' (apostrophe).
</li>

<br />

<li style="list-style-type: none;">Example:
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">That is Jamie's horse.
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">(Adding 's means Jamie owns the horse.)
</li>

<br />

<li style="list-style-type: none;">This is Chris' notebook.
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">(Because the name Chris has only one syllable and ends with s, we only add -' (apostrophe).
</li>

<br />

<li style="list-style-type: none;">B. Possessive Pronouns
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: none;">Instead of using names, we can also use the following pronouns to show ownership. Study the sentences and the table
