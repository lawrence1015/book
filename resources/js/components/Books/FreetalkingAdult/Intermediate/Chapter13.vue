   <p>Losing bloods and lives during battles are inevitable. The struggling parties or nations, with their causes in waging a war become tolerant of this plight. Their goal is to protect their territory so as not to be alienated in their own land, so each nation has no choice but to retaliate to defend its perimeters.
   </p>
   <p>But the pitiful image of suffering people has to stop and this was perceived by humanitarians so the Red Cross was established to mitigate the disasters and mediate peace. Another resounding body that rose to answer warring nations issue in peace establishment is the United Nations.
   </p>
   <p>Like the Red Cross, United Nations earned a Nobel Peace Prize award in 2001. The organization was planned by the allies, with the United States in the lead, during World War II, and in 1945, it replaced the League of Nations as a forum of safeguarding world peace. Because of the widespread recognition that humankind could not afford a third world war, the United Nations was established to replace the flawed League of Nations in 1945 in order to maintain international peace and promote cooperation in solving international economic, social and humanitarian problems.
   </p>
   <p>The term United Nations was coined by Franklin Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States to describe the Allied countries which favored to the ideal goal of the war. The United Nations was officially established on October 24, 1945 after the drafting of the United Nations Charter was ratified by the five then-permanent members of the Security Council - France, the Republic of China, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom and the United States.

 <p>There are 193 member states, including every internationally recognized sovereign state in the world, but the Vatican City. From its offices around the world, the UN and its specialized agencies decide on substantive and administrative issues in regular meetings held throughout the year. The organization has six principal organs: the General Assembly (the main deliberative assembly); the Security Council (for deciding certain resolutions for peace and security); the Economic and Social Council (for assisting in promoting international economic and social cooperation and development); the Secretariat (for providing studies, information, and facilities needed by the UN); the International Court of Justice (the primary judicial organ); and the United Nations Trusteeship Council (which is currently inactive).
 </p>

 <p>
  Other prominent UN System agencies include the World Health Organization (WHO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
 </p>

 <p>
  The United Nations Headquarters resides in international territory in New York City, with further main offices at Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed from assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states, and has six official languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish.
 </p>

 <p>
  The UN's most prominent position is Secretary-General which has been held by Ban Ki-moon of South Korea since 2007.
 </p>

 <p>
  At present, a nation in power to insinuate a war against another nation is an abomination to the organization. The United Nations considers the signature of a member country a symbol of understanding to the common goal of achieving world peace and alleviating the human race from poverty and other social and political injustices.
