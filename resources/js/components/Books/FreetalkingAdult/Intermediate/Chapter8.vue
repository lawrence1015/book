   <p>Have you ever wondered why people around the world behave differently? Do you have any acquaintances, friends, relatives or even family members who live in another country? If you do then cultural differences are not new to you.
   </p>
   <p>At present, migration has become a necessity to some people. Most of them are those who do business that require multicultural engagements to achieve their goals. Expats are sent by their respective companies to either oversee or administer outsourced partners abroad. Career oriented individuals fly out of their countries to pursue their personal satisfaction in the world of jobs and for a greener pasture.

<p>Knowledge and skill seekers find it very necessary to study abroad
To gain more advanced information and highly updated techniques in facilitating learning. These are just a few of the many reasons why we need to be aware of cultural differences.
</p>

<p>
  Cultural differences are the variations in the way of life, beliefs, traditions and laws between different countries, religions, societies and people. Many people see culture as an all-encompassing overview of large groups of people. However, the word culture can be used to describe the way of life of much smaller groups.

  </li>

  <li>Language - different countries tend to have their own language and methods of communication. However, there are sub-cultural differences, such as regional accents or sign language.
  </li>

  <li>Rules I Laws - cultures can often be recognized by the regulations they have to live by. However, lesser known rules can prove problematic .For example, tourists unaware of local custom may be arrested for inappropriate behavior.

  <p><i>Read the following statements about culture and cultural diversity. Discuss your opinion about each quote and statement with your teacher.</i></p>


  <ol>

      <li>The historic sharing of cultural advances, until they became the common inheritance of the human race, implied much more than cultural diversity. - Thomas Sowell
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>I can't tell you what Americans think because everyone is different but I can tell you what I think. - Makoto (Japanese blogger)
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Yet when an Italian newspaper reported on a horrifying incident on a Turkish beach, in which the prohibition on touching a woman who was not a close relative prevented men from saving a group of drowning girls, many, not only in the West, were shocked.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>When a Russian saves a fellow Russian, the savior gets the life of the one being saved as his extension. When a Chinese saves a life, the savior is responsible for the life of the one being saved.
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>No culture can live if it attempts to be exclusive. - Mahatma Gandhi
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Every man's ability may be strengthened or increased by culture. - John Abbott
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>The ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas, i.e., the class which is the ruling material force of society, is at the same time its ruling intellectual force.- Karl Marx
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>If everyone is looking for it, then nobody is finding it. If we were cultured, we would not be conscious of lacking culture. We would regard it as something natural and would not make so much fuss about it. And if we knew the real value of this word we would be cultured enough not to give it so much importance. - Pablo Picasso
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Diversity is not about how we differ. Diversity is about embracing one another's uniqueness. - Ola Joseph
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Culture shock can have a huge impact on international business if not recognized and dealt with effectively.
      </li>
