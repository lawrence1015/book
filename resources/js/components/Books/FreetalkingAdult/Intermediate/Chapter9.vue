   <p>The contemporary Olympics event is one clear view of cultural differences and gender fair. Either you watch the event on television or you are physically present at the venue, a showcase of exterior representations of participating countries is a real head turner. From the different flags around the world, to assortments of national symbols that give color to the agora, the world becomes blind of the diverse cultures and revels with the athletes with their crowds, regardless of complexion and race.
   </p>
   <p>But, how did the Olympics start?
   </p>
   <p>According to historical records, the first ancient Olympic Games can be traced back to 776 Be. They were dedicated to the Olympian gods and were staged on the ancient plains of Olympia. The games were held every fourth year, with the four year span being called an Olympiad.
   </p>
   <p>From what we know of them, players were brutal spectacles, with few rules and a strong emphasis on proving the participants' masculinity. Women were not even allowed to be spectators, and the penalty if they were caught was to be thrown off a nearby cliff.
   </p>
   <p>While one legend claims the games were established by Heracles also known as Hercules, who brought a sacred olive tree to Olympia, an alternative myth has the hero Pelops established the festival after defeating King Oenomaus in a chariot race. Whatever the precise origin of the games, they became a central aspect of Greek culture very early on and in many ways were the most important factor uniting the Greeks, except for their language and mythology.
   </p>
   <p>Today, the Olympics has become a picture of strength of both men and women. It's been an international event that advocates world
      Peace and unity. Olympic Games in its earliest history may not have great beginnings, but its present is totally promising.
