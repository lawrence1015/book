               <div style="padding : 16px;">

   <p>For the past millennia, humans have created wondrous, useful things. This proves our ingenuity and skill, setting us apart from other creatures. Through the years, we have kept on upgrading. The super computers we now have only started with the abacus; the massive fleets, from simple rafts; and the spacecrafts and airplanes, from kites and the mere wish to fly. Only our will and imagination is the limit. We must never forget though that whatever we create should not destroy our planet or humanity itself.

<p>Thomas Alva Edison will always be the epitome of an inventor. He is the famous inventor of the light bulb, early motion picture cameras, recorded music, electric car battery and others. As the creator of the phonograph, he was actually slightly deaf in both ears due to scarlet fever in his youth. As a student, his mind often wandered in his class. His teachers found him difficult to deal with. His mother pulled him out from school and taught him at home herself.
He was only 22 years old when his first invention was sold for $40,000. Several of his inventions failed and many of his businesses went bankrupt but Edison remained persistent and resilient. He once said, “I have not failed, I just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.”
