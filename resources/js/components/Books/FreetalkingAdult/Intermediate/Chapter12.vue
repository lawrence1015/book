   <p>One best precept of an organization which confers greatest benefits to the human race is the Red Cross. It won four Nobel Peace Prizes including the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to one of its originators, Jean-Henri Dunant in 1901.
   </p>
   <p>The birth of the Red Cross movement is inspired by the book "A Memory of Solferino", written by Henri Dunant himself which tells his personal experiences with the victims of war in Solferino, one of the towns in northern Italy, during his travel to Italy to meet Napoleon III to discuss business difficulties in Algeria, since Dunant was a Swiss businessman. He sent copies of the book to leading political and military figures throughout Europe.
   </p>
   <p>Contained in the book were his vivid descriptions of the suffering of the wounded soldiers, the aftermath of the war and the almost-absent medical attendance and basic care. Also, he expressed his intentions to form a national voluntary relief organizations to help nurse wounded soldiers at war and to develop international treaties to guarantee the protection of neutral medics and field hospitals for soldiers wounded on the battlefield, in the said book.
   </p>
   <p>It was the advent of the formation of the "Five Committee" , composed of Dunant, Gustave Moynier, who was a General lawyer and president of the Geneva Society for Public Welfare; Louis Appia, who was a field surgeon; Theodore Maunoir, from the Geneva Hygiene and Health Commission; and Guillamue-Henri Dufour, who was renowned Swiss Army general. This happened after Moynier received a copy of the book in 1863.

 <p>The Red Cross symbol is one of the five proposals written in the final resolutions adopted on October 29, 1863, in the international conference by the committee which was attended by 36 people coming from different states and kingdoms represented by their delegates. Such states and kingdoms were Austria, Baden, Bavaria, France, Prussia, Russian Empire, Saxony, Spain, Sweden, Norway, and the United Kingdom. According to research, the flag of Switzerland is said to be where the Red Cross originally have been derived from.
 </p>

 <p>
   The Red Cross now and then has not faltered with its image as an international philanthropic movement. Its missions to protect human life, ensure respect for all human beings, and to prevent and alleviate human suffering, with no discrimination based on nationality, religious beliefs, gender, race, class or political opinions, are still carried on by its estimated 97 million volunteers, members and staff worldwide.
 </p>

 <p>
  The Red Cross' missions pose a challenge to prove our care to our fellowmen, who may not be dying at war, but who may be dying for any reason. Life is a gift. There's no greater sense of happiness knowing that you've saved lives. Have you given a blood lately?

   </p>


   <ol>

       <li>Today as the Red Cross embarks upon its second century of service, each of us has an opportunity and an obligation to become a part of this humanitarian tradition. For only through our help is this important work made possible.
           -President John F. Kennedy, 1963
       </li>
       <br />
       <li>For millions of people in need... the Red Cross is a brilliant point of light-part of that vast galaxy of individuals, businesses, schools, churches, synagogues, and voluntary associations working together to solve problems... For 109 years that star has shone anytime there has been a need-anywhere there is a need. And today it dazzles still. .. Providing light at the end of the tunnel, a rainbow through the clouds.
           -President George Bush, 1990
       </li>
       <br />
       <li>On every battlefield, a flag of mercy flies. Its white field bears a Red Cross-the universal symbol of human compassion. Under that flag, there are no enemies, no racial or religious animosities. There are only brothers.
           -President Lyndon B. Johnson, 1968
       </li>
       <br />
       <li>In order to help meet a growing post-war need, which would be multiplied in the event of a national emergency, this agency has inaugurated a national blood program intended to ensure eventually the availability of life-saving blood to the entire nation.
           -President Harry S. Truman, 1949
       </li>
       <br>
       <li>The services of the Red Cross demonstrate our nation's tradition of neighbor helping neighbor.
           -President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1959
