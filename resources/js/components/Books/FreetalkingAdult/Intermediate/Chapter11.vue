   <p>The Pulitzer Prize is a U.S. award for achievements in newspaper and online journalism, literature and musical composition. It was established in 1917 by provisions in the will of American (Hungarian­ born) publisher Joseph Pulitzer, and is administered by Columbia University in New York City.
   </p>
   <p>Prizes are awarded yearly in twenty-one categories. In twenty of these, each winner receives a certificate and a US$10,000 cash award. The winner in the public service category of the journalism competition is awarded a gold medal, which always goes to a newspaper, although an individual may be named in the citation.
   </p>
   <p>Joseph Pulitzer's passion in reporting or in journalism gave way to the sprouting of The Pulitzer Prizes. He even offered Columbia University's president, Seth Low in 1892, money  to set up the world's first school of journalism but the university initially declined the offer. In 1902, with the new president, Nicholas Murray Butler, Columbia University reconsidered the offer to put up a journalism school, including the journalism prizes which were fulfilled not until after the death of Joseph Pulitzer.
   </p>
   <p>Pulitzer left the university $2,000,000 in his will. In 1912 the school founded the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. This followed the Missouri School of Journalism, founded at the University of Missouri with Pulitzer's urging. Both schools remain among the most prestigious in the world.

<p>In 1917, Columbia organized the awards of the first Pulitzer Prizes in journalism. The awards have been expanded to recognize achievements in literature, poetry, history, music and drama.
</p>

<p>
  The current Pulitzer Prize category definitions in the 2008 competition, in the order they are awarded, are: public service, breaking news reporting, investigative reporting, explanatory reporting, local reporting, national reporting, international reporting, feature writing, commentary, criticism, editorial writing, editorial cartooning, breaking news photography (spot news photography) and feature photography; fiction, drama, history, biography or autobiography, poetry and general non-fiction; and Pulitzer prize for music.
</p>

<p>
  But, who was Joseph Pulitzer?
</p>

<p>
  Joseph Pulitzer,   born Pulitzer József, was a Hungarian-American newspaper publisher of the St. Louis Post Dispatch and the New York World. Pulitzer introduced the techniques of "new   journalism" to the newspapers he acquired in the 1880's. He became a leading national figure in the Democratic Party and was elected Congressman from New York. He crusaded against big business and corruption. He was born on April 10, 1847 and died on October 29, 1911.
</p>

<p>
Pulitzer displayed a flair for reporting. He would work 16 hours a day - from 10AM to 2AM. He was nicknamed "Joey the German" or "Joey the Jew". He joined the Philosophical Society and frequented a German bookstore where many intellectuals hung out.
</p>

<p>
  In 1878, at the age of 31, Pulitzer married Kate Davis, an intelligent, compassionate woman of high social standing from a wealthy Mississippi planter family. She was five years older than he was. They had several children. In 1898, their older daughter, Lucille Pulitzer, died at the age of 17 from typhoid fever.

      <li>It’s all right to tell a wife the brutal truth, but you've got to go sort of easy with your lady-love.
          - Zoë Akins
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>Curious, isn't it that "talking with the right people" means something so different from "talking with the right person"?
          - Margaret Ayer Barnes
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>There are evils... That have the ability to survive identification and go on forever... Money, for instance, or war.
          -Saul Bellow
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>A hand is not only an implement, it's a sense organ. It's the eye of the blind man, it's the tone of those who cannot speak.
          - Pearl S. Buck
      </li>
      <br>
      <li>We are all such accidents. We do not make up history and culture. We simply appear, not by our own choice. We make what we can of our condition with the means available. We must accept the mixture as we find it - the impurity of it, the tragedy of it, the hope of it.
