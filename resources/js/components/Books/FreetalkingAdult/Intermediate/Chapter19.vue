   <p>Bullying is the use of force or coercion to abuse or intimidate others. The behavior can be habitual and involve an imbalance of social or physical power. It can include verbal harassment or threat, physical assault or coercion and may be directed repeatedly towards particular victims, perhaps on grounds of race, religion, gender, sexuality, or ability. The victim of bullying is sometimes referred to as a "target."
   </p>
   <p>Bullying can be defined in many different ways. The UK currently has no legal definition of bullying, while some U.S. states have laws against it. Bullying consists of three basic types of abuse - emotional, verbal, and physical. It typically involves subtle methods of coercion such as intimidation.

     Forty-nine states in the United States have passed school anti­bullying legislation, the first being Georgia in 1999. The one state without anti-bullying legislation is Montana. A watchdog organization called Bully Police USA advocates for and reports on anti-bullying legislation. North Dakota's legislature passed and Gov. Jack Dalrymple signed a bill into law April 22, 2011, which defines bullying in state law and outlines prevention policies for North Dakota public schools. North Dakota has been praised for their new law. Prior to its passage, North Dakota did not have anti-bullying legislation. Georgia's anti-bullying legislation was strengthened in 2010 with the passage of Senate Bill 250. Senate Bill 250 included a provision allowing for those accused of bullying another student could be reassigned to another school in order to separate the offender and the victim of bullying.

     There's another form of bullying called cyberbullying. It is defined as is defined as "willful and repeated harm inflicted through the use of computers, cell phones, and other electronic devices."

   In line with cyberbullying, South Korea is a country which has been known to have a weird relationship with video games. They play them relentlessly, but the government is suspicious of them, so much so that they've actually forced kids to stop playing them so much to prevent bullying.
 </p>

 <p>Anti-bullying movements were established to combat the prevalence of bullying around the world. In the 2000s and 2010s, a cultural movement against bullying gained popularity in the English-speaking world. The First National Bullying Prevention Week was conceived of in Canada in 2000 by Canadian educator and anti-bullying activist Bill Belsey. The charity Act Against Bullying was formed in the UK in 2003. In 2006, National Bullying Prevention Month was declared in the United States. The Suicide of Phoebe Prince in 2010 brought attention to the issue in Massachusetts, and sparked reforms in state education. The It Gets Better Project was started in 2010 to combat gay teen suicides, and Lady Gaga announced the Born This Way Foundation in partnership with Harvard's Berkman Center for Internet & Society in 2011.

 <p>A 2012 paper from the Berkman Center, "An Overview of State Anti­ Bullying Legislation and Other Related Laws," notes that, as of January 2012,48 U.S. states had anti-bullying laws, though there is wide variation in their strength and focus. Sixteen states acknowledge that bullies often target their victims based on "creed or religion, disability, gender or sex, nationality or national origin, race, and sexual orientation" Each of the 16 employs a wide array of additional parameters, the paper notes, ranging from age and weight to socioeconomic status. Of the 38 states that have laws encompassing electronic or "cyberbullying" activity, 32 put such offenses under the broader category of bullying and six states define this type of offense separately.
