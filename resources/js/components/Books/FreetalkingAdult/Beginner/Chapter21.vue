               <div style="padding : 16px;">

<p>One of the most popular superheroes of all time would definitely be Batman. Created in 1939 by DC comics, the fictional Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne, an American billionaire. He witnessed the murder of his parents as a boy and swore to revenge on the criminals because of the injustice that he received. To many, he has been a favorite because he does not possess superpowers but only uses his intellect, wealth, technology and martial arts skills to protect the ordinary citizens of Gotham
City. He vastly and hastily gained popularity after his character was introduced.  He has been adapted into movies, books, video games and TV shows.

  <b>M</b>: I agree. His unique spider webs and agility are incredible. However, my favorite is Superman!
  <br>
  <b>F</b>: Oh, why is that? Superman funnily looks weird in his costume!
  <br>
  <b>M</b>: Okay, his underpants and cape looks funny but he is so strong. He can fly!
  <br>
  <b>F</b>: But only because he is an alien! He came from planet Krypton! Spiderman and Batman are real humans.
