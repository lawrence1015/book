              <div style="padding : 16px;">

<p>Technically, an acquaintance is somebody you just know slightly and a friend is someone you are very close to. However, I felt like I have to break the rules of definition when I met Becky. She is a happy-go-lucky girl I met at a friend's party. She and I did not know anybody else there so we stayed together. She was very talkative and also attentive so I did not feel shy talking to her about my life. At the end of the night we were as close as real sisters! I did not know if I should consider her as a friend or an acquaintance!  Tomorrow we are planning to eat lunch together and shop for new shoes!
