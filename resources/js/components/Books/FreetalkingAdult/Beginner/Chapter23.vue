               <div style="padding : 16px;">

<p>Some hobbies can actually payoff. One can make a living out of some of his hobbies. For instance, because I really like shopping, I have been hired by my neighbor Mrs. Sue to be her personal shopper. I also like to walk my dog in the park so she also pays me to walk her dogs for $50 per month occasionally. Since last year, I have been making some cash out of baking too! I often like to bake cupcakes and other pastries. One day I gave a box of pastries to my manager and she encouraged me to open my own shop. Now, I am running a small cafe in our neighborhood!
