   <p>Last night was the weirdest dream I ever had-or at least among those that I can remember. Michael Jackson was in my dream, dancing 'Billie Jean' in our family garage. I shooed him away because I found his singing noisy. Out of nowhere, an elephant fell into our garden from the sky. Mr. Jackson transformed into a ninja and began fighting with the elephant which actually had fangs and claws. What was funny was the Big Bang group appeared out of nowhere and pacified the elephant. I don't even like this band and I was shocked they were in my dream! Riding on the elephant's back, we all decided to go to North Korea. My math professor blocked our path and she said something in English. That was when I woke up and realized I still have to do my Math assignment!

<p>Dreams are thought to have meanings. Everything in our dreams represents our desires, fears and emotions hidden deeply in our subconscious. For example, when you dream about a baby, it signifies that your inner nature is innocent and uncorrupted. If you dream of a crying baby, it means you feel weak and deprived of attention. If a mad dog appears in your dreams, it means you are being attacked by those you thought are your friends. If you are able to kill the mad dog, it means you will overcome the bad opinions of others. Water symbolizes your emotions and spirituality. Boiling water means you're angry and negative emotions are going out of control. To dream of muddy water means you are keeping negative thoughts. Calm water means you have peace of mind.
