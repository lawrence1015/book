  <li style="list-style-type: none;"><i>I am glad to meet you ...</i></li>
  <li style="list-style-type: none;"><i>I'm over the moon. I'm on cloud nine.</i></li>
  <li style="list-style-type: none;"><i>He's a happy camper.</i></li>
  <li style="list-style-type: none;"><i>She's grinning from ear to ear.</i></li>


   <p>Just what is happiness?
   </p>
   <p>Is there a definite description to convey the elation of a merry person?
   </p>
   <p>The pursuit of happiness lingers as if it was one of the most elusive things to have when in reality it is the nearest thing to us next to our own selves.
   </p>
   <p>People become happy for random reasons: a power nap on a busy day, an unexpected message from your partner,watching the sunset at the beach, craving and having you favorite food or going for an afternoon walk at the park while shuffling your ipod.
   </p>
   <p>Although happiness is not measured by the tangible wealth we acquire, it won't be a bad idea to pamper the child in you from time to time and feel satisfied after.
   </p>
   <p>Some people hang on to people, others depend on a lifetime buddy such as pets or treasures but there are others who are glad with whatever life tosses to them. Simplicity and happiness is the perfect match for these chosen few who would always see the beauty of everything through hope-filled eyes.
