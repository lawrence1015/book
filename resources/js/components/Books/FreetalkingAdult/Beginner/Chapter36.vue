               <div style="padding : 16px;">

   <p>My name is Michael and I am a Filipino. There are about 170 languages in our country! Because my parents are from different regions, they spoke different languages to me when I was very young. This made me want to learn languages. Interest is the greatest motivating factor in learning anything. For example, I was interested in learning English and in fairy tales so I just quickly picked up the language as I read story books and adventure novels. It also helps that the TV programs shown in the national television have a lot of English in it. When you want to learn a new language, be sincerely interested. Most of all, love it and have fun!

     <div style="padding : 16px;">

<p>As an English professor for over eight years, here are some recommendations for learning the language easily. First, expose yourself to English as often as possible. Read an article aloud every day. Make it a habit to read in English. It doesn't matter if it is a magazine, a book or the back of a cereal box. Second, try not to fear it. Of course, it is intimidating to learn a foreign language. It will look hard at first but trust me, the more you expose yourself to it, the easier it gets. Third, practice making sentences even when you are alone. As you wash the dishes, talk to yourself aloud in English. And finally, learn to have fun in it! Watch English comedy shows, movies and learn songs!
